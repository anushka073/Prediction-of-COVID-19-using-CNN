# 🩺 COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-ray Images using CNN

This project aims to detect COVID-19 infection by analyzing chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch with **TensorFlow 2.0** and **Keras**. It demonstrates how deep learning can support rapid and accurate diagnosis in healthcare.

## 📌 Overview

The model was developed and trained on Google Colab using a publicly available dataset containing X-ray images of both COVID-positive and non-COVID patients. The neural network architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and dense layers with ReLU activation, ending with a sigmoid output layer for binary classification.

- **Classes**: COVID-19 Positive and Normal
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Image resizing and normalization
  - Data augmentation to improve generalization

## 🧠 Model Architecture

A Sequential CNN model was used with the following characteristics:

- **Convolutional Layers** for feature extraction  
- **Pooling Layers** to reduce spatial dimensions  
- **Dropout Layers** to combat overfitting  
- **Dense Layers** with `ReLU` activation  
- **Output Layer** with `Sigmoid` activation for binary classification  

**Optimizer**: Adam  
**Learning Rate**: 0.001  
**Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
